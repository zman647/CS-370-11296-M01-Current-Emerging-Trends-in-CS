The code here is to create an intelligent agent that can defeat a maze. The code I implemented is the Deep Q-Learning implementation. The main task was to complete the qtrain function that sets up the epoch, trains the neural network using stored experiences, and adjusts exploration.
It also monitors and prints win rate, win count, loss, and training progress.

1. The goals of a computer scientist are to create efficient algorithms, developing and maintaing software systems to meet need, creating artificial intelligence and machine learning such as in this class, work with data to come to conclusions, and securing data from attacks.
2. Approaching a problem as a computer scientist first invovles a understanding and definition of what the problem is. Then it should be researched in the realm of current solutions and their strengths and weaknesses. After this is done, an algorithm can be created, but it
should be done efficiently and well. Once that is done, it can be transferred to code, which should be tested and debugged. Lastly, evaluation is important and it should be maintained.
3. Ethical responsibilites for code include privacy and security, transparency, and safety. Code should also be user centered. Maintaing professional integrity is key.
